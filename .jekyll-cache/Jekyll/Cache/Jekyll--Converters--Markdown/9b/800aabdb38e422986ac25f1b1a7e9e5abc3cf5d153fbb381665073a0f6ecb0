I"Ò<p>The Left is good. It stands for progress and equality for all. The Left is youthful, kind, and well-intended. It‚Äôs rebellious, smart, and cool. The Left doesn‚Äôt believe in incentives, efficiency, free prices, or supply and demand. Instead, it thinks the economy can be nicely planned. It fights discrimination, except against its critics and the prosperous, who deserve to be silenced, plundered, and punished. The Left promises to impose perfectly self-defined fairness and social justice, while not judging or harming anyone. It‚Äôs intellectually and morally superior, and the times it ends up controlled by ruthless, incompetent dictators are just unfortunate derailments from its bright path. The Left aims to eliminate social hierarchies, through violence if needed, because it doesn‚Äôt believe performance has to be rewarded. Instead, it promises jobs and quality education, housing and healthcare, for free, to everyone. It is a way towards a glorious future, ‚Äúa brotherhood of man.‚Äù</p>
