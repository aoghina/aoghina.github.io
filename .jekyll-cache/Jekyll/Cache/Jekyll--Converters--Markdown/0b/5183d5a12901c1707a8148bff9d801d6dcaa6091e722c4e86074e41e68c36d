I"ö<p>When the first Covid-19 cases emerged in Europe a year ago, I considered myself lucky to be in The Netherlands, a country where the authorities were organized and sensible, presumably well-prepared to handle such a crisis - or so I thought.</p>

<p>Then I quickly became horrified.</p>

<p>At first, I was unnerved by the downplaying of the pandemic, similar to the approach in Sweden and the UK; the â€œno need to panic or change your behaviorâ€ announcements. While the Dutch authorities eventually changed their â€œherd-immunity strategyâ€ (without admitting they were wrong), there has been a long series of false statements, harmful official advice, and a complete lack of accountability.</p>

<p>A detailed timeline of the Dutch authoritiesâ€™ erroneous statements and disastrous (in)actions can be found here: <a href="https://www.containmentnu.nl/articles/timeline?lang=en">containmentnu.nl/articles/timeline</a>.</p>

<p>With the pandemic already raging in Europe, back in March 2020, The National Institute for Public Health (RIVM) explicitly stated on its website that there was no need to avoid crowded events. It was one of the first obviously wrong and disastrous statements made by the Institute and its leader, Jaap Van Dissel. Preventive measures in medical centers, elderly care, and schools were completely absent. There was a ridiculous insistence on handwashing for preventing an airborne disease, while even pregnant women had to insist on medical personnel wearing masks around them, sometimes unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>It took many months for the Dutch authorities to (grudgingly) admit the obvious fact that masks are useful in reducing the transmission of this respiratory disease. There have been cases of people being reprimanded at their work for wearing one (because â€œthere was no need,â€ and they were â€œscaring peopleâ€). When, eventually, authorities did advise wearing masks, they did so in very limited circumstances and insisted they had to be â€œnon-medicalâ€ (in other words, the least effective ones). It was surreal, and many people died simply because of this ridiculous stubbornness.</p>

<p>Then there was the misguided arrogance. â€œHere we do things differentlyâ€ (unlike in other countries where authorities panic for no reason, it was implied). â€œOur lockdown is intelligentâ€ (not stupid, like everybody elseâ€™s, it was implied). â€œWe will not start the vaccination program too soon to show-offâ€ (as other countries do, it was implied). These messages were fed to the public, and many took them at face value. You canâ€™t lose votes by telling your citizens theyâ€™re smarter than other people, I suppose.</p>

<p>Just like in Sweden, the â€œexpertsâ€ wanted to appear in control, not to be overreacting and being â€œsmart.â€ So they addressed a mass-panic they imagined was imminent instead of advising a change in behavior. During the first wave, PCR tests were rarely used due to an anticipated future shortage of tests, which never materialized. Masks were not recommended because â€œpeople might not wear them correctly,â€ and doing so would â€œgive them a false sense of security.â€ At the time of this writing, millions of fast coronavirus tests remain unused because the government â€œwants to take a careful approachâ€ to using them. This sort of overthinking and junk science has led to major, deadly delays, as authorities addressed imagined future problems more than the pandemic itself.</p>

<p>But what shocked me the most was not the â€œexpertsâ€ getting it so wrong; it was the publicâ€™s lack of reaction. Besides the fringe virus deniers, almost nobody was questioning the authorities or raising legitimate concerns about their slow reaction and mistakes - not even the media. Anyone who tried to would get shut down and referred to the â€œofficial guidelines.â€ Prime minister Rutte stated clearly that the goal was not to prevent people from being infected, but to not overwhelm the hospitals. Many citizens simply accepted this â€œherd immunityâ€ approach, where those outside â€œvulnerable groupsâ€ were intentionally left unprotected, so they could get infected.</p>

<p>There was an eery sense of blind trust and obedience in the air. In a secularized society, local â€œexpertsâ€ became gods. To this day, although responsible for countless deaths, none of those who made demonstrably false statements were accused of anything. They didnâ€™t even lose their jobs; instead, they continue to appear on TV and give advice.</p>

<p>They refused to acknowledge the role of both asymptomatic and aerosol transmission, despite overwhelming proof; there was little acknowledgment of Long-Covid and its impact; children were treated as if they were immune to this disease, with zero measures to protect them, and the life-threatening MIS-C that affects some children has not been linked to Covid-19 for a long time (as other countries did); masks were rarely used in schools; the official death count was not updated to include the people who died of Covid-19 but were never tested. The vaccination campaign was the last to start in Europe, its pace being excruciatingly slow, and most people only have the option to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is the least efficient and has the most concerning side effects (but itâ€™s the cheapest).</p>

<p>So, the downplaying and missteps continue, and nobody is pressing on these issues. In a consensus culture, whenever someone tries to raise the issue of mistakes and accountability, they get shut down quickly with statements such as â€œeveryone does their bestâ€ or â€œwho are you to know better than the experts.â€ And, despite all the evidence to the contrary, including the ridiculously slow vaccination pace (due to over-planning and trying too hard to be â€œfairâ€), which cost who knows how many lives, it appears that most people think the government has performed very well so far in handling this crisis. This, for me, is simply mind-boggling.</p>

<p>In a country where the authorities usually do a decent job, people have become complacent and are used to defer to the â€œexpertsâ€ instead of using critical thinking to draw their own conclusions. While this approach works in many cases, it painfully demonstrated its limitations during this pandemic. Coupled with misguided, wishful thinking and national pride that makes people uncomfortable thinking their authorities might be less competent than others, it muted essential criticism. I think the Dutch recipe for success has, unfortunately, worked against its citizens this time.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m writing this to document my impressions during these times. My view of the Dutch authorities and society has changed in the past year. In the meantime, we traveled to Romania. The government here recommended masks early on, started the vaccination campaign as fast as possible (people can schedule themselves online and chose a vaccine), and generally made more sense. We might not be safer here in the grand scheme of things, and there are definitely areas in which the Netherlands does better, but, at least for now, this feels right.</p>
