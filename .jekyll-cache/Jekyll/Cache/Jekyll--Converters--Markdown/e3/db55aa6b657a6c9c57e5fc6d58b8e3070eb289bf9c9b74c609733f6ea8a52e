I"€<p>Some claim immigration is good and shouldnâ€™t be restricted, others that itâ€™s bad and should be stopped. I think itâ€™s hormetic. As a Romanian living in the Netherlands, Iâ€™m currently an immigrant. And I believe that understanding the benefits as well as the risks of immigration is essential if we want to prevent repeating predictable tragedies in our beloved Europe.</p>
