I"×<p>Iâ€™m not a physicist, but physics fascinates me almost in the same way as some people see in science a source of universal truth. Itâ€™s an unfortunate confusion, as science, by definition, simply canâ€™t answer all questions. Theories are based on assumptions, so there is always a level beyond which the answers stop. Whatâ€™s more, some of the most fundamental phenomena still lack any kind of explanation. In short, we donâ€™t have a clue whatâ€™s going on.</p>
