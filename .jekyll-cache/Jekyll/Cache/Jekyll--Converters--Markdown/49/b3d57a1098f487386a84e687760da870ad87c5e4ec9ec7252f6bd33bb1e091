I"ì<p>Hate speech can lead to unspeakable tragedies. It happened during nazism, it happened during communism. I hope we will never let that happen again. But that doesnâ€™t mean burying our heads in the sand. It doesnâ€™t mean looking elsewhere when someone is killed next to us, pretending it is just a freak accident. It doesnâ€™t mean chasing fantasy dreams of world peace in our bubble and blaming anyone that wakes us up to reality. Because that can also lead to unspeakable tragedies.</p>
