Some Italian and Spanish politicians are very angry and harshly accuse The Netherlands of "not showing solidarity", by opposing the issuing of Eurobonds (or Coronabonds), which would effectively make the Dutch taxpayer cover their huge debts. Well, well... Let's look at some numbers.

Over the past 7 years, the Netherlands managed to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio from 67% to 52%. But reducing debt is not cool in most Southern European countries, where austerity is often a curse word. Over the same interval, Italy increased its debt from 129% to 135% of GDP, to a whopping €2 trillion. Spain increased it from 93% to 98%.

The Dutch population has elected mostly center-right parties who favored sustainable public expenses, understanding the need for increasing the pension age and realizing there's no such thing as a free lunch. "Solidarity" would have meant for all EU countries to do the same, to improve their common financial resilience and fortify the EU's position in the world. But who were most Italians and the Spanish voting for, during this time? Well, mostly for populists, who, despite having different stances on other matters, like immigration, always had one thing in common: promising more "free" stuff...

Spain is governed by an "anti-austerity alliance" led by the "Spanish Socialist Workers' Party" leader (yep, they basically voted a commie as PM) who declared he wanted a "post-capitalist society". Just like any other socialist, his entire platform is based on blaming "the bad capitalists", while buying votes with the money stolen from them. And he's frustrated that he can't simply confiscate from the Dutch as easy as he can "make the rich pay their fair share" in his own country.

Given all this, I find these harsh accusations a bit... rich. Especially since The Netherlands is also affected and has its own huge financial problems to face at the moment, and there are already other means of assistance in place that share the burden, like the ECB's €750 billion bond-buying program.

(Of course, these are simplifications and generalizations, I know there are plenty of Italians and Spanish people who are against socialists/populists; sadly, they're not the majority)
