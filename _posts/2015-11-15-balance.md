Hate speech can lead to unspeakable tragedies. It happened during nazism, it happened during communism. I hope we will never let that happen again. But that doesn't mean burying our heads in the sand. It doesn't mean looking elsewhere when someone is killed next to us, pretending it is just a freak accident. It doesn't mean chasing fantasy dreams of world peace in our bubble and blaming anyone that wakes us up to reality. Because that can also lead to unspeakable tragedies.
