I'm not a physicist, but Physics fascinates me almost as much as some people see in science a source of fundamental answers. In fact, science is not even trying to give such answers, and we don't have a clue what's going on.

### Time

We measure time with clocks and think of it as something that is constantly flowing forward, together with us and everything we see. We found out just a few decades ago that it actually flows differently for different observers and that it's possible to fast-forward through time by moving faster or getting closer to heavy objects.  But these are abstract notions that we can't relate to, and they don't clarify what time is. We don't even know if it's continuous or discrete and it seems like, from outside, our universe would simply look static.

### Space

We think of space as a three-dimensional emptiness in which our universe resides. We now know it to be intricately related with time in a continuum called spacetime, but have no clue if it's finite or infinite, if it has a shape and how it appeared. We don't know why our universe seems to have three spatial dimensions, and actually we aren't even sure if they are three.

Space is a mysterious topological void through which light and gravity propagate. They travel at an arbitrary speed which looks the same regardless of our own movement, and nothing can go faster. Experiments confirm it, but what causes this behavior and particular value is unknown.  

### Gravity

As we still commonly think of it as a force, gravity is now described as a consequence of objects bending the spacetime around them, pulling towards each other and dilating time. Again, nobody knows why this happens.

Matter makes up these objects around us, but we don't know what it itself is made of. We call matter's building blocks elementary particles, first believed to be atoms, then electrons, protons, neutrons and photons, and now quarks and leptons, each of different types. The deeper we look, the stranger things are, as particles sometimes behave as waves by spreading through space and interfering with themselves, and our observations seem to influence that. Matter has mass, another fundamental, yet elusive physical property that in some ways is equivalent with energy. There is also antimatter, which interestingly bears the properties of regular matter moving backward in time, and it is believed that most of our universe is actually made of dark matter, a hypothetical kind of matter that was not yet observed.

These are just some of the fundamental notions that we don't quite understand. Science is built on postulates, and although we get better at modeling the behavior of the world around us using complex, powerful formalisms, we're not answering the most simple questions. But science doesn't even attempt to do that. Physicist say they're just answering "how" questions, figuring out laws that can predict what we can observe. "Why" questions, they claim, have no definitive answer, as there will always be a certain base level of "why" where the answer can only be "because".
