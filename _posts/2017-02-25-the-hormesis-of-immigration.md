Some claim immigration is good and should be unrestricted, others that it's bad and should be stopped. In think it's hormetic. As a Romanian living in the Netherlands, I'm currently an immigrant. And I believe that understanding the benefits as well as the risks of immigration is essential if we want to prevent repeating predictable tragedies in our beloved Europe.

A phenomena is hormetic when it's beneficial at low doses but becomes harmful at higher ones. Hormesis applies to a wide range of processes, from physical effort, stress, hunger and the vaccine principle to sunlight or microbial exposure, alcohol consumption, taxation and nationalism. It also applies to immigration, which is favorable in certain conditions but can also trigger a sequence of events leading to destruction.

Most citizens are welcoming with foreigners and receive them with open arms at first. I still remember the curiosity I felt when meeting the first foreigners in post-communist Romania. The locals and the new arrivals can learn and complement each other, expand their view of the world, merge destinies and work together for a better life and common future. But when too many people come at once, it leads to frictions. The more arrive in a shorter period of time, the more different and compact their goals and values, the more dangerous the conflicts that arise. The positive effects of immigration revert and the atmosphere becomes polarized and toxic for everybody. It is a fatal mistake to think this problem can be solved with an integration course.

There are around 20,000 Romanians living in the Netherlands. That can already seem many to some, but what if we were two million? Since the Netherlands is a democracy and citizenship is attainable, we could form a political party - or an existing one would start supporting our cause. For most of us, the future of both our native and adoptive countries and cultures matter. What happens though if interests begin to collide? In this case it's a somewhat unlikely scenario, since Romania and the Netherlands are both members of the EU and NATO, but it's not impossible. If that happens, wouldn't the native Dutch rightfully feel threatened and angry that new arrivals, myself included, undermine the interests of their country? Wouldn't it naturally follow that some would start supporting newly emerged parties that express hostility towards us? When immigration becomes heavily politicized, it means it already passed its beneficial zone and is turning destructive.

We tend to think of things as either good or bad. But even the vital water can turn deadly when consumed in large quantities. Once a nation builds itself on a homeland, immigration is good in certain conditions. Quantity, cultural compatibility, the skills and goals of new arrivals matter. To me it seems that countries in Western Europe have already passed their hormetic zone. One quarter of the London population was born outside Europe. In France, 20% of the metropolitan population currently consists of immigrants, some of whom resent their adoptive country. Only blinded by indoctrination can someone think these percentages can rise indefinitely without harm.

It's ignorant to call names and apply offensive labels to a growing part of the population and dismiss their worries about their country and culture being threatened. It's true that these feelings are amplified and exploited by ruthless politicians that gain from people's fears. Natives might eventually overlook the benefits of migration, even turn violent and overreact badly, but overreaction is still a reaction to something. Frictions need to exist before hate can grow.

Romania's freedom came 44 years after the end of World War II. Few know that before being forced behind the Iron Curtain, it had one of the most democratic constitutions in Europe. Despite the shared values, Latin roots, the political and security stability, it took 11 years before its citizens were allowed to visit EU states without a visa and another 8 years before finally being admitted in the Union. During this pre-integration process, Romanians patiently spent hours waiting in long lines to request visas for Western Europe. Today, 9 years after integration, there are still border checks as Romania is not accepted in the Schengen area (this might be a blessing in the end).

At the same time, thousands of unverified people enter and move freely across the continent every month. Many originate from areas where majorities hold values that conflict with freedom and the Western culture. A few executed terrorist attacks against civilians. Official figures show that 60% of recent migrants coming from outside Europe are not eligible for asylum and yet they are allowed to stay. The countless tragic drownings that turned the Mediterranean into a mass grave are heart-wrenching, but one has to ask: how many could have been avoided if people wouldn't have been invited to Germany (without consulting the German people or the other member states), although other countries on the way were safe, but less appealing?

Ensuring the security of its citizens is the top responsibility of any political entity that claims monopoly on the legal use of violence: when the Union fails to do so and leaves its external borders unprotected, it's just a logical consequence that anti-EU populist parties are gaining traction. It's a shame when these parties win, but who is to blame?

Who's pushing this forward? Who denies reality most vocally and insists uncontrolled immigration can proceed at any rate, with no harm? Who thinks that borders and cultural compatibility don't matter? Who claims to be "inclusive" but vilifies anyone that does not agree with them? Who else than the leftists, the misguided dreamers who always promise the most tasteful omelets and invariably end up with only broken eggs. It is they who bear the responsibility for Brexit and the rise of anti-immigration sentiment. Their actions weaken the economy, polarize society, sabotage the common European identity and inflate nationalism. But most Europhiles continue to support them. Nationalist eurosceptics are the only ones blamed, although their rise is more of a symptom rather than a cause. And causality matters.
