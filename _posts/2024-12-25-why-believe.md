How can a rational person believe in a “man in the sky”? How can modern people, with all our scientific knowledge and technological advances, still believe in miracles, resurrection, and all the other incredible stories of religion without scientific proof?

Why pray, follow religious teachings, or dedicate your life to an elusive God instead of simply enjoying yourself as much as possible?

These are questions we’ve all asked ourselves. The easy, common answer instilled in us today is simple: we shouldn't. Religion is outdated. Its purpose, we are told, is to control people and explain things we couldn’t explain before scientific discoveries. It has no place in modern society—it's merely a vestige of the past. Even worse, religion can contribute to conflicts, causing pain and suffering. Some even suggest we should work toward eradicating it to make the world a better place... "forgetting" that a godless “better world” was what communists aimed to create a century ago, resulting in the deaths of millions and the destruction of entire nations.

I believe this answer is not only superficial but also logically flawed. It disregards the question of morality and the true meaning and roles of science and religion. And this perspective contributes to the decay of the Western world, replacing purpose, meaning, and strength with confusion, individual suffering, and collective weakness.



## What is religion?

Religion is fundamentally a belief system. At its core, it offers a moral code that determines which behaviors, actions, thoughts, and life pursuits are good and beneficial and which are bad and destructive. Critics of religion often obscure this essence and the fact that science, by definition, cannot replace a belief system since it holds no moral values.

We all have a belief system—a set of moral postulates that shape our worldview and behavior. Western civilization is rooted in Christianity, which has been instrumental in its development. Many things we consider “naturally” good or bad, as well as many laws in the Western world, are derived from Christian morality. Other societies are based on different belief systems, which shape their values, legal systems, and aspirations.

Theism is more than a value system; belief in God brings implications and benefits beyond distinguishing right from wrong. It’s essential to understand that a society’s predominant belief shapes its foundation, rules, freedoms, and ultimate success.


## What is science?

Science is our endeavor to discover the rules that govern the observable universe. We use these rules to describe, predict, and sometimes manipulate and benefit from natural phenomena. However, science cannot provide or replace a moral system. No matter how advanced our knowledge becomes, science remains a tool for understanding how the universe works and improving our lives. Science does not address why things are as they are or whether an action is good or bad, even in apparently obvious situations.

Science also cannot answer the primordial questions of existence. All fundamental scientific theories are based on postulates—assumptions accepted, by definition, without proof. Thus, science cannot explain how the rules we observe came about. It cannot explain how time and matter were created or what existed before the Big Bang.

Furthermore, science cannot fundamentally explain concepts we take for granted, such as matter, energy, and time. We have excellent models that describe their behavior, but science cannot explain their essence. It cannot even definitively determine whether time itself exists. But more on that later…


## Religion vs. science

Science and religion address different aspects of human experience. They are not in conflict, despite how they are often portrayed. Many great scientists were religious and expressed this beautifully:

**Isaac Newton (Physicist and Mathematician, Founder of Classical Mechanics, Calculus, Optics, Mathematical Physics)**

*Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who sets the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done.*

**Albert Einstein (Physicist, Founder of the Theory of Relativity):**

*Science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action. [...] Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.*

**Louis Pasteur (Chemist, Microbiologist, Founder of Microbiology):**

*Little science takes you away from God, but more of it takes you to Him.*

**Werner Heisenberg (Physicist, Founder of Quantum Mechanics):**

*The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass, God is waiting for you.*

**Max Planck (Physicist, Founder of Quantum Theory):**

*Both religion and science require a belief in God. For believers, God is in the beginning, and for physicists, He is at the end of all considerations.*

**Michael Faraday (Physicist and Chemist, "Father of Electricity"):**

*The book of nature, which we have to read, is written by the finger of God.*

**Francis Collins (Geneticist, Director of the Human Genome Project):**

*The God of the Bible is also the God of the genome. He can be worshiped in the cathedral or in the laboratory. …I found there is a wonderful harmony in the complementary truths of science and faith.*

All scientific theories are based on foundational assumptions — postulates accepted without proof. This means that science, while objective in method, rests on principles that cannot themselves be objectively proven. Consequently, atheism — the complete denial of any guiding belief system — doesn’t truly exist in practice. Even if someone rejects belief in the Christian God, they still operate according to certain principles, values, or “gods” that shape their thoughts, behaviors, and worldview.

Western civilization, in particular, owes much of its progress to Christian principles. Christian educators and legislators promoted literacy for the masses, and established laws protecting human life and individual liberty. Christian scientists, like Wilhelm Röntgen, Michael Faraday, Werner Heisenberg, and Sister Mary Keller, made groundbreaking discoveries that laid the foundation for modern technology and medicine. Their work illustrates that the supposed conflict between Christian faith and science is a false narrative.

## Do we really need God to have a moral system?

Certainly, we can attempt to define a set of moral values to distinguish good from bad without invoking God. But who determines these values? The majority? Political leaders? Both have historically made grievous moral errors.

Without God as an anchor, morality becomes fragile and adaptable to personal impulses and desires. When morality is not grounded in an unchanging foundation, it can be twisted to justify almost anything. The horrors of the past century illustrate this vividly: mass theft, torture, and genocide were justified — even celebrated — by their perpetrators as the “moral” course of action. The Reign of Terror during the French Revolution, the Holodomor, the Holocaust, the Red Terror, and the Cultural Revolution were all atrocities committed under ideologies that rejected belief in God, and claimed to "know better".

Fyodor Dostoevsky captures this idea poignantly in his exploration of human nature: “If God does not exist, everything is permitted.” While this may seem difficult to grasp at first, history shows its truth. At an individual level, remorseless crimes can arise from moral relativism. On a national scale, the absence of an absolute moral foundation can lead to collective atrocities. This erosion of morality often begins within each of us, particularly when we face situations where crossing ethical boundaries offers personal gain without immediate consequences.


## "But look, we are doing fine without God!"

Are we? The truth is, many of our legal systems, personal freedoms, and moral codes still rest on Christian values. Concepts like kindness and forgiveness are not intrinsic to human nature, which is also capable of vengeance and destruction. Even the separation of Church and State — a cornerstone of our civilization’s success — stems from Christian thought. As Jesus said, “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.”

In other systems, this balance often collapses. Religions that are militant in nature tend to enforce rigid theocracies. Conversely, atheistic ideologies like socialism frequently turn political leaders into false gods, with their portraits adorning public spaces and their dogmas becoming a form of secular authoritarianism. Dissent becomes dangerous, and the system itself becomes impossible to oppose.

As societies move away from Christianity, they often seek meaning in other belief systems. This can lead to short-sighted hedonism or the worship of false idols: charismatic leaders with “new ideas” (false prophets), wealth, physical appearance, or even nature (animals, objects, or nature). The wisdom inherited from our ancestors is frequently ignored. In this environment, genuine kindness and altruism risk being replaced by virtue signaling. The value of human life is no longer held sacred, and moral principles like forgiveness, humility, and nonviolence become conditional rather than absolute.

This erosion leaves us confused, weakened, and more susceptible to control and violence. In many secularized countries, societal trends show signs of decline. Mental health issues are rising, while economic stability and birth rates are falling. Family structures are weakening, and projections point to an aging population facing the risk of demographic collapse.

Of course, Christians do not always embody Christian values perfectly, and people of other beliefs can share similar moral principles. However, a moral system without a firm foundation is vulnerable to distortion and decay. This flexibility creates fertile ground for destructive ideologies. Nihilism often takes hold, leaving people devoid of meaning, purpose, and a desire to contribute to future generations. In times of hardship, this moral void can justify theft, violence, and even genocide.

History has shown how dangerous this can be. The moral emptiness left by the rejection of faith was filled by Nazism and communism, ideologies that used collective deception to catastrophic ends. Today, nihilism, hedonism, and socialism threaten to fill that void again — potentially paving the way for the next societal collapse.

## Does God *really* exist?

We might agree that Christian values and morality have merit, yet some believe God can be removed from the equation because He “doesn’t really exist.” But let’s pause and consider: Does matter really exist? Does time really exist? Do we really exist? What does it even mean to exist? These are deeper questions than they first appear, and even science offers answers that are far from straightforward.

For example, some interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest that time may not be fundamental to the universe. The “arrow of time” — our sense that time flows forward — might simply reflect our perception of increasing disorder (entropy), not an actual feature of reality. Events might not “happen” as we perceive them but instead exist eternally at fixed points in spacetime. If this is true, the flow of time is merely an illusion.

The more deeply we explore these concepts, the more elusive the nature of “true existence” becomes. It all hinges on how we define existence itself. By its very nature, the existence of God in a material form cannot be “proven” through the tools of empirical science, because those tools are part of His creation. As the Creator, God transcends the material world, which is why belief in His existence is a matter of faith.

Yet God’s existence manifests clearly in multiple ways:

1. **God as the Initiator:**
   He exists as the origin of the universe and the laws that govern it. Even if you don’t believe in the Christian God, whatever you consider to be the force that initiated existence can be understood as God.

2. **God as the Ultimate Role Model:**
   He shapes the moral framework and beliefs we live by. Even those who reject the Christian God adopt values or principles that serve as their “god” — whether consciously or subconsciously — guiding their thoughts, decisions, and actions.

3. **God as Faith in Action:**
   God exists through the transformative power of faith. The impact of faith on human lives is undeniable. Countless testimonies describe how belief in God has saved people in their darkest moments, inspired them to choose righteousness, and provided strength in times of crisis.

## Why Jesus?

There are so many religions out there - why would we consider Christianity the "right one"? Why would it be better than any of the others? Some even say that "all religions are equal", but what does that mean? Are all belief systems "equal"? Do we really think that a religion that advocates kindness and forgiveness is equal in value to one that promotes, let's say, violence, retribution, and death?

This is all subjective of course as it depends on each of our core values, each of our belief systems, proving once again how important that is. But for whoever agrees that love, forgiveness, kindness and generosity are cardinal rules in life that lead to a better world, less suffering, and personal fulfillment, Christianity is the obvious, rational choice - simply because these are the cardinal values of Jesus.

Beyond rationality though, belief in Jesus is a matter of transformational faith, which has a deep impact in the lives of those who decide to follow Him. 

## The Benefits of Faith

Besides providing a moral compass and an ethical guide, Christianity has many more objective, earthly benefits. Jesus graciously gives us meaning and purpose, and helps us navigate life's challenges with resilience and hope - especially in times of uncertainty and adversity.

Numerous studies have highlighted the positive impact of faith on mental and emotional health. Research across various fields, including psychology, sociology, and medicine, show the benefits associated with religious belief and practice, such as reduced depression and anxiety, enhanced coping mechanisms, lower suicide rates, and increased resilience. Even religious practices, like fasting, have clear positive health benefits.

Christian values of compassion, forgiveness, and humility are also pillars upon which individuals can build their character, fostering integrity and empathy in their interactions with others. This contributes to a more just and equitable society, with respect for human dignity and the common good - in a natural, voluntary, and altruistic way, not in the abusive, forceful, missguided way that socialism claimed it can reach the same goals, and failed miserably. 

Central to Christian teachings is the call to love one's neighbor and serve those in need. This ethos of altruism and compassion inspires countless individuals and organizations to engage in charitable endeavors and philanthropic initiatives. From feeding the hungry and sheltering the homeless, to advocating for justice and promoting human rights, Christians around the world have always made efforts to alleviate suffering and promote human flourishing. And, as it's often overlooked today, Christianity played a major role in the abolition of slavery.

## Concusion

While God will always be a matter of faith, the deceptive simplifications that use Science as a conter-argument for God simply do not hold under scrutiny. Faith has always been a trait of advanced human civilizations. Besides providing purpose, meaning, and a moral code, God is also defined as the initiator of Creation. In that sense, in one form or another, we all believe in a god, whether we realize it or not. I chose Jesus, for His values, His love, and the Truth He provides. Ultimately, the question is not *why believe*, as we all do, but why would you chose anyone else, and how is that god better than Him, for yourself, the ones around you, and society.
